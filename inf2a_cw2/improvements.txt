Things that shouldn't work but work:
- Who like ducks?
- Who are ducks John likes?
- Who is an orange orange orange orange orange orange orange duck?

Things that I would like to implement:
- John likes ducks

Also I think that if Mary is a duck and John likes Mary doesn't neccessarily mean that John likes ducks.
